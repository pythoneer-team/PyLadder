# General Rules

The players will move their pieces from left to right, starting at 1, following the numbers on the board, then the next row from right to left, and repeat. If a player rolls a 4, then the player would move their piece four places.
Hot Dice:
If a player rolls a 4, then the player would have one more turn to play.
Snakes:
When a player lands on top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake, unless a math question is answered correctly.
Ladders:
When a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder if and only if a math question is answered correctly.
