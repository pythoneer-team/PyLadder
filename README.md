## Cooperation Plan

#### All team members have variety of strength and skills but these are the key strengths for each,
  ####              	        (Dedication, Creativity, Patience ,Focused)

 
   ### Detail oriented “Creative" team member is always helpful coming up with new original ideas for the team, where a "dedicated" one can always make sure everything is going by the plan and the timeline, pushing other members to achieve more, "patient "member can always help in helping other members if they faced a problem so he will be there to explain and motivate and not give up, we always need a member who is "focused" because sometimes with the work pressure we could lose focus and need someone to drag our attention
   ###  A team member who is good at "communicating" is always helpful in connecting the dots to a final result with the help of a" detail oriented " member to help him/her to connect the dots correctly.
   #### As every team member is unique in one strength but all members should know and understand the full aspects of the project in which case a daily meeting with all the team members should be held to follow up and check on the progress of the project.
 


## Conflict Plan
   #### In our team we will resolve all the conflicts by not avoiding it and deal with these uncomfortable issues as soon as possible by talking together about the disagreements and how we feel about the situation then finding points of agreement, if we didn’t have any resolution, we will have help from our team leader and the course instructor as the final step of the conflict resolution.
 ####   Our team will make sure that we will communicate well with each other and all the tasks will be divided and very clear to all the team members so no one will work more than the other and we will all contribute with each other.
   #### To be far away from misunderstanding and individual skill level difference between members all of us will ask for help if needed from each other and try to search a lot about any problem we face to fasten the project work and Spread individual experiences
 
 
## Communication Plan
  ####   As a team we have agreed on our main working hours as it will be the lab time during the lecture time and we made another working schedule to continue our work after the lap time, we will have 10 min break every two hours .
####  Our day off will be on Friday to have a good rest .
 ####  As we will use (ZOOM & Slack) during the lap time and (WhatsApp) after as communication tools to ensure that everyone will share their voice.

## Work Plan 
#### Identifying and assigning the tasks shall be done in a meeting with the members where all of us will express how the tasks should assigned according skills to get the best result from the team, knowing when tasks will be completed will be through the members, when each member finishes his/her tasks we will hold a meeting to go through it make sure it’s all according to plan we will of course have deadlines, and will manage the project through breakout room.
 #### we will use the management tools that are available outside as
 #### (GitHub), (Zoom meeting) and (discord), we also define our progress plan and define some milestones that work as indicators that we are making progress in this project.

 
## Git Process

#### The components of our project will be interface (GUI).We will create an organization, each one of us will use a branch to work on it, we will push our work on the branch then make pull request to our work every day in the next morning and discuss it with the team leader before merge, we will continue this till we finish the whole project and then push to the main.
